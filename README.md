# OOP 2021 snippets

This repository will contain code snippets related to the 2021 OOP course to clarify concepts. I will add things when I feel like it and this is by no means always up-to-date with the latest course subjects. This repository is not managed by the university and no rights can be derived from its contents. It's just here to clarify some concepts with code examples or otherwise, and because I like doing this. Feel free to share this with other students.
